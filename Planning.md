# Our MCP Project Planning Document

## Project Overview

**Our MCP Project** is an open-source MCP (Model Context Protocol) service designed for financial services companies and institutions to manage compliance with identified "Conduct Requirements". Our MCP Project serves as a universal Standards engine, initially implementing the FCA Handbook as our first ingested Standard. The system is designed to rapidly ingest any well-articulated Standard, using the word "Standard" widely to include regulatory frameworks (FCA Handbook, SEC rules, MiFID II, Basel III), industry codes (conduct codes, best practice guidelines), statutory requirements (legislation, acts, laws), international standards (IFRS, SOX, ISO standards), jurisdictional regulations (state, provincial, national requirements), and consultation documents (regulatory proposals, policy consultations, draft guidance).

### Strategic Context

Compliance with legal, regulatory, and industry requirements has become particularly challenging for Financial Services organizations. Regulatory requirements proliferate at an accelerating rate, and traditional attempts to streamline compliance often create additional layers of regulatory red tape that compound complexity rather than reducing it.

The consequences of non-compliance can be severe - both in public reputation and legal liability. Prior to AI, this regulatory burden was becoming unmanageable, creating mounting friction, costs, and reduced agility for Financial Institutions.

**Our MCP Project's mission is to slice through red tape** by leveraging AI power through open-source innovation and MCPs (Model Context Protocol) accessible by any AI agent or LLM, making compliance manageable and efficient, ultimately serving the goal of **making it easier to bring the right financial products safely to consumers**.

### Technical Vision

This comprehensive planning document reflects deep understanding of how regulatory principles align with AI capabilities, combined with enterprise-grade technical architecture designed to meet the complex needs of financial services compliance. Our MCP Project transforms compliance from a burden into intelligence that scales with AI adoption, with **MCP tools that turbocharge AI effectiveness by providing specialized compliance intelligence that transforms general AI agents into compliance experts**.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Create an MCP-compliant service for financial regulatory compliance management
- Provide AI-powered compliance analysis and gap identification
- Support regulatory reporting and inspection preparation
- Maintain long-term memory for improved responses over time
- Ensure LLM-open architecture with proven default and privacy controls

### Initial Scope
- **Regulatory Focus**: FCA Handbook (UK Financial Conduct Authority)
- **Target Users**: Compliance Officers, Risk Managers, Regulatory Inspectors, Professional Advisers
- **Core Technology Stack**: Python, Pydantic, LightRAG, GitHub
- **Default LLM**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (with architecture supporting LLaMA 3, Falcon, Mistral Medium, and user-defined models)
- **LLM Architecture**: FSCompliance MCP server operates independently from enterprise AI agent LLM choices - organizations can use any LLM for their AI agents while benefiting from FSCompliance's proven Claude 3.5 Sonnet compliance intelligence
- **LLM Strategy**: See LLMChoice.md for comprehensive analysis and strategic rationale

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Compliance Gap Analysis**: AI agents submit policy text to identify the ten most salient requirements and flag compliance gaps
2. **Customer Risk Assessment**: AI agents query customer records against FCA requirements (e.g., "For customers aged 60+ holding Bitcoin, did the risk warnings meet FCA requirements?")
3. **Regulatory Reporting**: AI agents generate draft reports for regulatory inspections based on FSCompliance knowledge base
4. **Consultation Document Analysis**: AI agents analyze consultation documents to transform regulatory uncertainty from reactive scrambling to proactive strategic planning

### Secondary Use Cases
- Real-time compliance monitoring and alerts
- Regulatory change impact analysis
- Training material generation for compliance teams
- Audit trail generation for regulatory compliance
- Consultation impact assessment enabling strategic planning before regulatory change becomes binding
