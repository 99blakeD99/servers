## Project Overview

**The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project** is the open-source compliance intelligence platform built exclusively for financial services. We make regulatory intelligence accessible to any AI agent through innovative MCP integration while increasing the effectiveness of compliance professionals. Built as a universal Standards engine with the FCA Handbook as our first ingested Standard, the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project rapidly ingests any well-articulated Standard, broadly defined to include regulatory frameworks, industry codes, statutory requirements, international standards, jurisdictional regulations, and consultation documents. The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project is positioned as the first MCP-integrated compliance platform, **with MCP tools that turbocharge AI effectiveness by transforming general AI agents into compliance experts**, ultimately serving the goal of **making it easier to bring the right financial products safely to consumers**.

## Architecture

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project follows a layered architecture as the first MCP-integrated compliance platform:

1. **MCP Server Layer**: Protocol-compliant JSON-RPC 2.0 server
2. **Knowledge Management Layer**: LightRAG-powered FCA Handbook processing
3. **Compliance Intelligence Layer**: AI-powered requirement analysis and gap detection
4. **Memory and Learning Layer**: Long-term memory with privacy controls
5. **LLM Abstraction Layer**: Multi-model support with Claude 3.5 Sonnet default (LLaMA 3, Falcon, Mistral Medium alternatives). **Architectural Independence**: Our MCP server operates independently from enterprise AI agent LLM choices

### Strategic Architecture Decisions
- **LLM Strategy**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet selected as default based on extensive real-world validation through the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project development; no fine-tuning architectural decision per `LLMChoice.md`
- **LLM Independence**: Our MCP server runs its own LLM completely separately from enterprise AI agent LLM choices, eliminating adoption barriers from corporate LLM standardization decisions
- **Database Evolution**: Migrating to Supabase (PostgreSQL + PGVector) per `DatabaseStrategy.md` for simplified architecture and real-time capabilities
- **MCP Tool Priority**: 6 priority tools identified in `ComplianceTools.md` for Phase 3 implementation
- **Brand Positioning**: Positioned as first MCP-integrated compliance platform per `Brand.md` competitive analysis
- **UI/UX Design**: Professional financial services interface specifications detailed in `UserInterface.md`

### Key Technologies
- **Python 3.11+** with Poetry for dependency management
- **Pydantic v2** for data validation and serialization
- **LightRAG** for knowledge retrieval and graph processing
- **FastAPI** for web framework and MCP server implementation
- **Supabase** for unified database with real-time capabilities (migration planned Q3 2025)
- **OAuth 2.1** for authentication and security

## Universal Standards Definition

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project uses "Standard" widely to include:
- **Regulatory frameworks** (FCA Handbook, SEC rules, MiFID II, Basel III)
- **Industry codes** (conduct codes, best practice guidelines)  
- **Statutory requirements** (legislation, acts, laws)
- **International standards** (IFRS, SOX, ISO standards)
- **Jurisdictional regulations** (state, provincial, national requirements)
- **Consultation documents** (regulatory proposals, policy consultations, draft guidance)

This universal approach enables the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project to serve as a comprehensive compliance intelligence platform across multiple regulatory contexts.

## Development Guidelines

**Always consult `Rules.md` before starting development work.** Key principles:

- Follow layered architecture from `Planning.md`
- Maintain MCP protocol compliance
- Create comprehensive Pytest unit tests
- Never exceed 500 lines per file
- Include regulatory source citations in compliance logic
- Implement privacy controls for all memory features
- Validate all inputs, especially financial/customer data

## Strategic-to-Implementation Translation

**Key Implementation Requirements from Strategic Documents:**

### From LLMChoice.md:
- **Default LLM Configuration**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet must be default in config files/environment variables
- **Multi-Model Architecture**: Code must support configurable LLM providers (Claude, LLaMA 3, Mistral, user-defined)
- **Architectural Independence**: The MCP server LLM choice operates completely independently from AI agent LLM choices

### From Touchstones.md:
- **Universal Standards Engine**: Code must support rapid ingestion of new regulatory frameworks beyond FCA Handbook
- **Self-Hostable Architecture**: All components must be deployable on enterprise infrastructure
- **Standard Models + RAG**: No fine-tuning infrastructure - use standard LLMs with advanced retrieval

### From ComplianceTools.md:
- **MCP Tool Priority**: Implement 6 priority tools in Phase 3 (monitor_regulatory_changes, analyze_consultation_impact, score_compliance_risk, track_audit_evidence, map_regulatory_relationships, validate_customer_scenarios)
- **Tool Specifications**: Each tool requires specific schemas, validation, and response formats
- **Consultation Document Analysis**: Implement `analyze_consultation_impact` tool to transform regulatory uncertainty into strategic planning intelligence

### Project vs Product Naming:
- **The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project**: Refers to project, codebase, development initiative - use in technical documentation, git commits, code comments
- **The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product**: Refers to deployed product - use in user-facing interfaces, API responses, configuration

### Documentation Standards:
- **UK Date Format**: Use "DD Month YYYY" format (e.g., "25 December 2024") in all documentation
- **Professional Tone**: Corporate financial services audience - avoid colloquialisms, be succinct
- **Touchstones Consistency**: Check strategic decisions against Touchstones.md principles
- **Document Quality**: Follow ReviewRules.md methodology for systematic document reviews with multi-stakeholder perspectives

## Target Users

- Compliance Officers
- Risk Managers  
- Regulatory Inspectors
- Professional Advisers

## Use Cases

Based on ComplianceTools.md analysis and current MCP tool roadmap:

### Primary Use Cases (Phase 2 Complete)
1. **Compliance Gap Analysis**: AI agents analyze policies to identify the ten most salient requirements and flag compliance gaps using `analyze_compliance` and `detect_gaps` tools
2. **Regulatory Intelligence**: AI agents extract relevant requirements from FCA Handbook using `extract_requirements` for specific policy or scenario analysis
3. **Compliance Assessment**: AI agents provide comprehensive policy analysis against regulatory requirements with confidence scoring

### Advanced Use Cases (Phase 3 Implementation)
4. **Regulatory Change Monitoring**: AI agents track FCA Handbook updates and assess impact on existing compliance frameworks using `monitor_regulatory_changes`
5. **Consultation Document Analysis**: AI agents analyze consultation documents to transform regulatory uncertainty from reactive scrambling to proactive strategic planning using `analyze_consultation_impact`
6. **Risk-Based Compliance**: AI agents score compliance risk across policies and business activities using `score_compliance_risk` with prioritization recommendations  
7. **Audit Trail Management**: AI agents collect and organize compliance evidence for regulatory examinations using `track_audit_evidence`
8. **Regulatory Relationship Mapping**: AI agents visualize connections between regulations and business activities using `map_regulatory_relationships`
9. **Customer Scenario Validation**: AI agents validate customer scenarios against FCA requirements (e.g., "For customers aged 60+ holding Bitcoin, did the risk warnings meet FCA requirements?") using `validate_customer_scenarios`

### Future Use Cases (Phase 4+)
9. **Automated Regulatory Reporting**: AI agents generate draft regulatory reports and submissions using `generate_compliance_reports`
10. **Remediation Planning**: AI agents suggest specific compliance remediation actions using `suggest_remediation`

## Strategic Document Review Process

When reviewing any .md file, follow the systematic methodology in ReviewRules.md:
1. **Content Quality**: Check professional tone, avoid repetition, ensure internal consistency
2. **Touchstones Alignment**: Verify consistency with Touchstones.md principles
3. **CLAUDE.md Impact**: Assess whether changes require updates to implementation guidance
4. **Multi-Perspective Review**: Evaluate from stakeholder viewpoints (CEO, CCO, CTO, CISO, CRO, IT Director, Purchasing Director, Head of AI, Operational Director, Regulatory Affairs Director)

**Coding-Relevant Documents** that may require CLAUDE.md updates:
- Planning.md, LLMChoice.md, Rules.md, ComplianceTools.md, Tasks.md (direct coding impact)
- FAQ.md, Brand.md, UserInterface.md (UI/UX and user-facing elements)

**Strategic-Only Documents** (no CLAUDE.md impact):
- FCAsandbox.md, TakeToMarket.md, DatabaseStrategy.md, MgmtImpactRules.md, UpdateCheck.md, Touchstones.md, ReviewRules.md
