## Project Overview

**The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project** is the open-source compliance intelligence platform built exclusively for financial services. We make regulatory intelligence accessible to any AI agent through innovative MCP integration while increasing the effectiveness of compliance professionals. Built as a universal Standards engine with the FCA Handbook as our first ingested Standard, the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project rapidly ingests any well-articulated Standard, broadly defined to include regulatory frameworks, industry codes, statutory requirements, international standards, jurisdictional regulations, and consultation documents. The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project is positioned as the first MCP-integrated compliance platform, **with MCP tools that turbocharge AI effectiveness by transforming general AI agents into compliance experts**, ultimately serving the goal of **making it easier to bring the right financial products safely to consumers**.

## Architecture

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project follows a layered architecture as the first MCP-integrated compliance platform:

1. **MCP Server Layer**: Protocol-compliant JSON-RPC 2.0 server
2. **Knowledge Management Layer**: LightRAG-powered FCA Handbook processing
3. **Compliance Intelligence Layer**: AI-powered requirement analysis and gap detection
4. **Memory and Learning Layer**: Long-term memory with privacy controls
5. **LLM Abstraction Layer**: Multi-model support with Claude 3.5 Sonnet default (LLaMA 3, Falcon, Mistral Medium alternatives). **Architectural Independence**: Our MCP server operates independently from enterprise AI agent LLM choices

### Strategic Architecture Decisions
- **LLM Strategy**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet selected as default based on extensive real-world validation through the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project development; no fine-tuning architectural decision per `LLMChoice.md`
- **LLM Independence**: Our MCP server runs its own LLM completely separately from enterprise AI agent LLM choices, eliminating adoption barriers from corporate LLM standardization decisions
- **Database Evolution**: Migrating to Supabase (PostgreSQL + PGVector) per `DatabaseStrategy.md` for simplified architecture and real-time capabilities
- **MCP Tool Priority**: 9 priority tools identified in `ComplianceTools.md` for Phase 3 implementation
- **Brand Positioning**: Positioned as first MCP-integrated compliance platform per `Brand.md` competitive analysis
- **UI/UX Design**: Professional financial services interface specifications detailed in `UserInterface.md`

### Key Technologies
- **Python 3.11+** with Poetry for dependency management
- **Pydantic v2** for data validation and serialization
- **LightRAG** for knowledge retrieval and graph processing
- **FastAPI** for web framework and MCP server implementation
- **Supabase** for unified database with real-time capabilities (migration planned Q3 2025)
- **OAuth 2.1** for authentication and security

## Universal Standards Definition

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project uses "Standard" widely to include:
- **Regulatory frameworks** (FCA Handbook, SEC rules, MiFID II, Basel III)
- **Industry codes** (conduct codes, best practice guidelines)  
- **Statutory requirements** (legislation, acts, laws)
- **International standards** (IFRS, SOX, ISO standards)
- **Jurisdictional regulations** (state, provincial, national requirements)
- **Consultation documents** (regulatory proposals, policy consultations, draft guidance)

This universal approach enables the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project to serve as a comprehensive compliance intelligence platform across multiple regulatory contexts.

## Development Guidelines

**Consult `Rules.md` for development standards and `Planning.md` for architecture decisions before starting development work.** In case of conflicts, this document hierarchy applies: 1) CLAUDE.md, 2) Rules.md, 3) Planning.md, 4) Other strategic documents.

**Key principles:**

- Follow layered architecture from `Planning.md`
- Maintain MCP protocol compliance
- Create comprehensive Pytest unit tests
- **Pragmatic Excellence**: Balance quality with practical implementation - focus on core compliance functionality first, then optimize
- **Iterative Development**: Implement minimum viable functionality first, then enhance based on validation results
- Follow file size guidelines per Rules.md (500 lines preferred, 1000 lines maximum for complex tools)
- Include regulatory source citations in compliance logic
- Implement privacy controls for all memory features
- Validate all inputs, especially financial/customer data

## Quality Standards (from TechnicalArchitecture.md)

**Performance Targets:**
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ for core compliance logic, 75%+ for integration components, 60%+ for UI/UX components
- **Response Time**: <5 seconds for standard queries, <30 seconds for complex analysis, <60 seconds for comprehensive document analysis

## Strategic-to-Implementation Translation

**Key Implementation Requirements from Strategic Documents:**

### From LLMChoice.md:
- **Default LLM Configuration**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet must be default in config files/environment variables
- **Multi-Model Architecture**: Code must support configurable LLM providers (Claude, LLaMA 3, Mistral, user-defined)
- **Architectural Independence**: The MCP server LLM choice operates completely independently from AI agent LLM choices

### From Touchstones.md:
- **Universal Standards Engine**: Code must support rapid ingestion of new regulatory frameworks beyond FCA Handbook
- **Self-Hostable Architecture**: All components must be deployable on enterprise infrastructure
- **Standard Models + RAG**: No fine-tuning infrastructure - use standard LLMs with advanced retrieval

- **MCP Tool Priority**: Implement 9 priority tools (quickly_check_compliance, systematically_analyse_compliance_implications, identify_compliance_requirements_in_specific_case, prepare_draft_compliance_audit_report, map_relationships, validate_ground_truth, ingest_new_identified_standard, update_identified_standard, suggest_remediation)
- **Tool Specifications**: Each tool requires specific schemas, validation, and response formats
- **Tool Naming Convention**: Use lowercase format for tool names (e.g., `quickly_check_compliance`, not `quickly_check_Compliance`)
- **Ground Truth Validation**: Implement `validate_ground_truth` tool for enterprise accuracy benchmarking with confidential testing environment

### From LegalLiability.md:
- **Liability Framework Integration**: Implement user interface components that integrate liability reminders and warnings
- **Initial Liability Acceptance**: Code must require acceptance of liability terms before system access
- **Periodic Liability Reinforcement**: Implement notifications during extended user sessions to reinforce liability framework
- **Tool-Specific Warnings**: Implement warnings for high-risk activities, particularly Standard ingestion using `ingest_new_identified_standard` tool
- **Audit Trail Requirements**: Implement comprehensive logging and documentation systems for compliance audit purposes
- **Permanent Record Systems**: Code must support user IT systems maintaining permanent records of tool usage, outputs, and professional review processes
- **Emergency Procedures**: Implement system limitation warnings and alternative compliance verification prompts during errors/outages
- **User Responsibility Reinforcement**: All tool outputs must include disclaimers that AI-generated content requires human review and validation

### Project vs Product Naming:
- **The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project**: Refers to project, codebase, development initiative - use in technical documentation, git commits, code comments
- **The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product**: Refers to deployed product - use in user-facing interfaces, API responses, configuration

### Documentation Standards:
- **UK Date Format**: Use "DD Month YYYY" format (e.g., "25 December 2024") in all documentation
- **Professional Tone**: Corporate financial services audience - avoid colloquialisms, be succinct
