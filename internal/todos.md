---

---

## Completed Todos ✅

### Documentation & Content Strategy
- ✅ Add FAQ question about demo hosting options and why traditional web hosting (like one.com) won't work for FSCompliance
- ✅ Add FAQ question comparing FSCompliance's custom memory approach vs MCP-Mem0/OpenMemory solutions
- ✅ Review FAQ.md and add '(To be organised in due course)' notes to items requiring manual arrangement (like expert reviews, user acceptance testing) vs things Claude Code can implement or that happen automatically
- ✅ Add separate FAQ section/subsection on Human in the Loop requirements and add disclaimer about responsibility for correct results and their usage
- ✅ Add to FAQ that Claude uses Rules.md for development guidelines and coding standards
- ✅ Add FAQ section referencing GuardRails.md and explaining the comprehensive AI safety measures
- ✅ Add Vision & Mission section to FAQ.md after development disclaimer but before AI Agent Integration section

### Brand & Strategic Positioning
- ✅ Develop comprehensive brand values and positioning document covering: Focus (Financial Services), B2B, Professional, Trustworthy, Expert-backed, Innovative, Global, Open, Accessible. Create positioning statement and competitive differentiation
- ✅ Examine all .md files to make sure they square with the new ComplianceTools.md and add Blake Dempster, Founder, CEO, Principal Architect attribution where appropriate

### Strategic Planning & Analysis
- ✅ Review all pre-Phase 3 tasks to check whether they align with ComplianceTools.md, and make appropriate changes. Then add appropriate tasks to Phase 3 onwards
- ✅ Create internal/FCAsandbox.md capturing strategic opportunity and draft comprehensive answers to all FCA application questions (3.1-5.3) including solution overview, AI role, differentiation, impact, technical requirements, testing plan, and milestones
- ✅ Evaluate database architecture options: Current PostgreSQL + Qdrant vs Supabase (PostgreSQL + PGVector + real-time). Consider compliance requirements, self-hosting needs, vector search performance, and Cole Medin's recommendations for financial services architecture

### User Interface & Presentations
- ✅ Create FAQ.html version with nested structure similar to JBMD website format for professional presentation while keeping FAQ.md as source of truth
- ✅ Consider adding new category in Tasks.md after Phase 2, maybe 'Carry out detailed review of project so far' and shuffle existing tasks as necessary
- ✅ Create comprehensive UI mockup for demo version showing what FSCompliance looks like in practice. Create UserInterface.md as collection point for evolving design ideas, user workflows, personas, and interface concepts
- ✅ Create working HTML prototype (internal/UserInterface.html) to provide tangible first look at FSCompliance dashboard and key interface elements

### Quality Assurance & Consistency
- ✅ Review all content .md files (FAQ.md, Tasks.md, ComplianceTools.md, and internal files) for consistency in terminology, branding, attribution, and technical details
- ✅ Review Rules.md, Planning.md, and CLAUDE.md to reflect all documentation created and ensure they serve as accurate foundational guides (do this after content review)

### Development & Git Management
- ✅ Commit .gitignore changes and ComplianceTools.md to GitHub with appropriate commit message
