# Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Brand Positioning & Values

*Internal brand strategy document for Universal_FSCompliance_MCP platform*

## Instructions for when reverting to Brand.md:

1. Scoop up anything useful now in Brand.md
2. Collect from .claude.json.backup our discussions about name 
3. Include in its entirety the report which researched fit of name with brand values (in which we got a score of 84%)
4. Extract the brand values that we produced on the fly for that research
5. Check whether they still fit: first suggest what approach is needed for such a check, and make sure we have evidence to justify the choice of brand values
6. Formulate brand instructions such that for example if we construct UserInterface.html we can refer to such instructions
7. Include in its entirety verbatim the anecdote about cliché so we can decide how to make use of it

The intent of this exercise is to ensure that we arrive at good decisions, but also that we leave a record of the process used in arriving at this decision.
